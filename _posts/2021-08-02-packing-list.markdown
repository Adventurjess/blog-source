We visited Costa Rica from late May to the end of July,  the start of rainy season. Whenever you go, some parts of Costa Rica, such as Arenal rain all year round so this packing list should cover all your needs.

### Reasons Why We Think Visiting in May to July is Best

1. Low season = Cheaper accommodation, quieter attractions

2. Rain = Lush greenery and animals are more active

3. Cooler = More comfortable weather to do your activities

In summary, do not let the rain put you off going at this time. It usually falls heavily for a short time in the afternoon/evening, and so you still get beautiful, bright mornings to get out and about. The sun rises and set early, so the earlier you get up, the most you can make of the sunshine.

### Packing for Costa Rica in the Rainy Season

Costa Rica is hot, humid and often very wet. This means clothing can take days to dry if they're of certain material and can go mouldy. Saying this, we didn't get any mould. We packed with the following in mind:

1. Aim to be cool, comfortable and dry.

2. Pack light, airy clothing, rolled up tightly in dry bags which will stop the humid air from making them damp. (I had several dry bags and separated tops, bottoms and underwear to keep me organised).

3. To keep baggage lighter, alternate used tops and shorts before washing (you're going to sweat again as soon as you're out of the shower, along with everyone else and no one will care). This also reduces laundry costs and environmental impact.

4. Mosquitos. If one thing will ruin your trip, it's bug bites. Buy all the medication/antihistamines/bug spray that you might need beforehand as toiletries and medication are super expensive (26$ USD for 10 tablets!).

### Packing List

I used an Osprey Farpoint 40L backpack and a 25L day backpack (Northface Borealis).

### üëï Clothing

- [ ]  Day outfits x 5 (5 tops and 3 shorts will make 15 outfits!)¬π
- [ ]  Evening outfits x 2 i.e. light dresses
- [ ]  Socks x 4
- [ ]  Underwear x 7
- [ ]  Bras x 2 (+ bikini tops can double up!)
- [ ]  Swimwear x 2
- [ ]  Thin fleece
- [ ]  Long sleeved top x 1
- [ ]  Leggings x 1 ¬≤
- [ ]  Light waterproof trousers (great for night walks)
- [ ]  Waterproof coat / poncho I bought an expensive torrential proof coat, and a ¬£20 poncho. Guess which one I used more ¬≥

¬π I'd recommend tops that cover shoulders for sun protection and comfortable, airy shorts. Have in mind what you'll be doing i.e. walking, hiking, beaching, taking *long* bus trips.

¬≤ You will not need any other long trousers. Forget jeans. The only time I wore long trousers were for an afternoon in Monteverde, which is higher in the mountains, and whilst night patrolling as sandfly protection.

¬≥ A poncho is perfect because it's light weight, will fit in your day pack and will cover both you and your bag. 

### üëü Footwear

- [ ]  Hiking boots
- [ ]  Sandals that can withstand wet/mud i.e. no leather

- [ ]  Sunglasses
- [ ]  Glasses / Contact lenses

- [ ]  Passport (stored in a plastic wallet)
- [ ]  Travel Insurance Documents
- [ ]  Driving License
- [ ]  Money (A card with no international fees, such as Monzo or Revolut, and a current account card)

(NOTE: Costa Rica's payment systems much **prefer VISA cards**. We both took Monzo mastercards and whilst contactless payments did tend to work, we often struggled to get cash from ATMs. We only had fee-free success with **BAC ATMs** and even then it was a fine art to get the machine to accept a card. Additionally, some towns including Drake Bay, despite being very touristy, are still wild and have **NO BANKS**. Plan ahead to ensure you don't get caught out.

- [ ]  Toothbrush
- [ ]  Toothpaste
- [ ]  Shampoo/ conditioner
- [ ]  Hair comb
- [ ]  Shower gel
